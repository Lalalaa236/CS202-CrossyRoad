## Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic Crossy Road game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The goal of the game is to navigate a character across a busy road, avoiding obstacles and reaching the other side safely.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is designed using OOP principles, with classes and objects representing different game entities such as characters, obstacles, and the game environment.

- **Graphics and Animation**: Utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide an engaging and visually appealing gaming experience. Animation is implemented to enhance the realism of movement and interactions.

- **Randomized Obstacles**: Obstacles, such as vehicles and animals, are generated randomly to create dynamic and challenging gameplay.

- **Scoring System**: Implements a scoring mechanism to track the player's progress. The score increases as the player successfully navigates through obstacles.

- **Levels and Difficulty**: The game may include multiple levels with increasing difficulty, offering a more challenging experience as the player advances.

## Requirements

- **Programming Language**: The project is implemented in C++, so ensure that you have a C++ compiler that supports C++11 features installed on your system.

- **External Libraries**: raylib

- **Dependencies**: **Make** - The project utilizes a Makefile for compilation. Make sure you have the `make` utility installed on your machine.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lalalaa236/cs202-crossy-road.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd cs202-crossy-road
```

## Compile and Run

1. Compile the code using the provided Makefile:
```bash
make
```
This command will compile the source code and generate the executable `CrossyRoad.exe`.

2. Run the game:
```bash
./CrossyRoad.exe
```
The game should start, and you can now enjoy playing Crossy Road.

## Clean Up
To clean up the compiled files and start fresh, you can use the following command:
```bash
make clean
```

This will remove the generated executable and any intermediate files.

## Customization
If you need to customize the compilation process or make any adjustments, you can modify the Makefile to suit your needs.
