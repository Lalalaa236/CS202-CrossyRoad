## Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic Crossy Road game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The goal of the game is to navigate a character across a busy road, avoiding obstacles and reaching the other side safely.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is designed using OOP principles, with classes and objects representing different game entities such as characters, obstacles, and the game environment.

- **Graphics and Animation**: Utilizes a graphical user interface (GUI) to provide an engaging and visually appealing gaming experience. Animation is implemented to enhance the realism of movement and interactions.

- **Randomized Obstacles**: Obstacles, such as vehicles and animals, are generated randomly to create dynamic and challenging gameplay.

- **Scoring System**: Implements a scoring mechanism to track the player's progress. The score increases as the player successfully navigates through obstacles.

- **Levels and Difficulty**: The game may include multiple levels with increasing difficulty, offering a more challenging experience as the player advances.

## Requirements

- **Programming Language**: The project is implemented in C++, and it requires C++11 or later.

- **External Libraries**: raylib

- **Dependencies**: Nothing
